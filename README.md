# Welcome to Copilot.Rocks 🤘🏻

This repo is the main repository for [copilot.rocks](https://copilot.rocks). Copilot.rocks is a cookbook to develop, build, and operate applications using AWS Copilot. 

This repo holds 2 main materials: 1) source code and 2) the docs itself. The source code can be found under `codes/` directory and the docs in `cookbook/` folder.

## Why cookbook?

The AWS Copilot documentation page already done a great job describing how to get started with AWS Copilot. Copilot.rocks aim for developers who want to understand few tips and tricks, as well as implementing more advanced patterns (such as Pub/Sub, Saga pattern, continuous delivery). 

This content of Copilot.rocks is structured in modular ways — called as workshop —  so readers don't need to sequentially follow all the workshops, and can just pick and implement based on their needs. Here
